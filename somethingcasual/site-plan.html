      <p>
        People want to learn more about things like art for the real world and
        cutting-edge technology but rarely pay attention to the industry and 
        art behind even the greatest games in history. Why? Video games have 
        long denoted a history of awkward, reclusive, and sometimes troublesome
        players who are often viewed as introverted and unhelpful to society. 
        Here a different picture is painted to light the real purpose in 
        community these players have in bringing more forms of art to digital 
        museums in almost every living room.

      <h3>What Exactly Does the Gaming Industry Have to Offer The Rest of the World?</h3>
      <p>
        When people see the first home page of my website, they will get the 
        appropriate perspective on the gaming community by showcasing the 
        impressive and helpful technologies made possible. Audience viewers can
        be presented with the abstract perspectives granted by the stories some
        of our favorite fictional characters live in and the non fiction 
        stories that would make you chuckle. Most importantly, highlighting the
        increasingly diverse and popular player-bases around the world is the 
        common goal of almost all development teams in the industry, each with 
        their own take on the focus to end borders and create communities.

      <h3>The Logistics and Help Needed Associated with Video Games.</h3>
      <p>
        The interactive exercises and fact givers will help peak interest in 
        the already rich history and impact of the video game world. Everybody 
        already has a relationship of some kind or another with video games, 
        which I can use to get past the unnecessary greetings from one gamer to
        a non-gamer and get straight to the facts and impressive timeline of 
        the video game industry. People already will be looking for information
        I offer anyway due to the industry's already impressive feat of 
        gaining a revenue of more than twice Hollywood and the music industries
        combined! Surely, the future is turning its gaze more attentively to 
        video games.
